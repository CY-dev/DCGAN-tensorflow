This is a TensorFlow implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. The project uses the [celebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset to create artificial celebrity faces. The [original repository](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) has been adapted to help you get started with the [ClusterOne](https://clusterone.com) deep learning computation platform.

The implementation is based on [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). The Torch code referenced in the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch).

This Readme provides instructions to run this DCGAN on ClusterOne. For more information, check out the [ClusterOne documentation](https://docs.clusterone.com/v1.0/docs/creating-celebrity-faces-using-a-dcgan) for this example.

## Install

To run this project, you need:

- [Python](https://python.org/) 3.5 or higher.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- The ClusterOne Python library. Install it with `pip install clusterone`
- A ClusterOne account. [Sign up](https://clusterone.com) for free if you don't have an account yet.

### Create the dataset

This example uses a small subset of the celebA dataset containing 1000 images to reduce file transfer times. You can of course also use the entire dataset. However, be aware that the dataset is large and may take a long time to upload to the ClusterOne server.

1. Download the reduced dataset [here](https://tensorport-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/celebA_small.zip). Unzip the downloaded file and `cd` into the directory with the data.
2. Log into your ClusterOne account using `just login`.
3. Then create a new dataset with `just create dataset`. Name the dataset `celeba-small`.
4. Upload the dataset to your ClusterOne account with `git push clusterone master`.

### Get the code ready

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open [main.py](/main.py) and change the flag at the top of the script to their appropriate value:

1. `CLUSTERONE_USERNAME`: Your ClusterOne username. This should be something like `johndoe`, not your email address!
2. `ROOT_PATH_TO_LOCAL_DATA`: The path to the dataset on your local machine.
3. `LOCAL_REPO`: The name of the local repository. 

### Create the project

Open a command line and `cd` into the root folder of the repository. Create a new project with `just create project` and name it `dcgan-demo`.

Push the project code to ClusterOne with `git push clusterone master`. The project is now uploaded to your ClusterOne account.

## Usage

Use the following command to create a job and run the project on ClusterOne. Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your ClusterOne username.

```shell
justt run --name 1-GPU-small-dataset --project YOUR_USERNAME/dcgan-demo \ 
--datasets YOUR_USERNAME/celeba-small  --module main \
--requirements requirements.txt --framework-version 1.0.0 \
--mode single-node \
--instance-type c4.2xlarge \
--time-limit 1h --description ""
```

The purpose of this fork is to teach you how to run DCGAN on ClusterOne. For more information about what you can do with the project code, make sure to have a look at the [original Github repository](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow).
