# DCGAN in Tensorflow

TensorPort tweak of this repo: https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow


Tensorflow implementation of [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) which is a stabilize Generative Adversarial Networks. The referenced torch code can be found [here](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch).

* [Brandon Amos](http://bamos.github.io/) wrote an excellent [blog post](http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/) and [image completion code](https://github.com/bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow) based on this repo.
* *To avoid the fast convergence of D (discriminator) network, G (generator) network is updated twice for each D network update, which differs from original paper.*

## Prerequisites

- Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+
- [Tensorflow 0.12.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r0.12)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
- (Optional) [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) (for visualization)
- (Optional) [Align&Cropped Images.zip](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) : Large-scale CelebFaces Dataset


## Usage

The dataset and code are pre-loaded on [TensorPort](www.tensorport.com) as `tensorbot/onboarding-DCGAN` and `tensorbot/celebA`.

Run it with `tport run` (see the [docs](docs.tensorport.com))
